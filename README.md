<h3>About Prophet</h3>
Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool created by Facebook. It's robust to missing data, shifts in the trend, and large outliers, making it applicable to a wide variety of time series data. The model works best with daily periodicity data with at least one year of historical data. This is our work on <a href="https://github.com/veridelisi/Forecasting/blob/main/Prophet/inflation.ipynb"> U.S Inflation Data.</a></p>
