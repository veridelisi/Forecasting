<h1>Forecasting Time Series </h1>
<h2>Facebook Prophet Forecasting Model</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This repository is dedicated to implementing and exploring the Facebook Prophet model, a powerful and flexible tool for time series forecasting. Prophet is designed for forecasting at scale, handling the kinds of data irregularities common in real-world business scenarios. More details about the model can be found at the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html">official Prophet documentation</a>.</p>

<h3>About Prophet</h3>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Prophet is an open-source forecasting tool created by Facebook. It's robust to missing data, shifts in the trend, and large outliers, making it applicable to a wide variety of time series data. The model works best with daily periodicity data with at least one year of historical data. This is our work on <a href="https://github.com/veridelisi/Forecasting/blob/main/Prophet/inflation.ipynb"> U.S Inflation Data.</a></p>

<h2>LSTM Forecasting</h2>
<p>This segment of the repository focuses on using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for economic forecasting. LSTM networks are a type of recurrent neural network ideal for analyzing and predicting time series data. This model is adept at understanding long-term dependencies and patterns in data, making it particularly useful for complex forecasting tasks.</p>

<h3>About LSTM</h3>
LSTM is a powerful neural network architecture used for sequential data prediction. It excels in forecasting time series data due to its ability to remember past data for long periods, making it highly effective for predicting economic trends and patterns. This section of our repository showcases our approach and findings using <a href="https://github.com/veridelisi/Forecasting/tree/main/">LTSM</a> for economic forecasting.
